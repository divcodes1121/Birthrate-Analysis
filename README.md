# Birth Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains Python code for analyzing and visualizing birth data using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The code processes birth data, creates pivot tables, and generates various plots to explore birth trends and patterns over different time periods.

## Getting Started

To run the code and replicate the analysis, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone` or download the ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:
     ```
     pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
     ```

3. **Data Input**:
   - Place your birth data in a CSV file named "births.csv" in the same directory as the Python script.

4. **Running the Code**:
   - Open the Python script in your preferred development environment or run it from the command line.

5. **Viewing Results**:
   - The code will display various plots and visualizations showing birth trends and patterns over decades, days of the week, and months. You can view these visualizations in your Python environment.

## Code Explanation

- The code begins by importing the necessary libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

- It reads birth data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame and displays the first few rows of the DataFrame.

- Data cleaning steps are performed, including filling missing values and creating a 'decade' column to represent birth decades.

- A pivot table is created to summarize total births by gender for each decade.

- Seaborn style is set for data visualization.

- Line plots are generated to show total births per year for each gender.

- Quartiles are calculated to identify a valid range for birth counts, and the DataFrame is filtered accordingly.

- The DataFrame index is set to a datetime format, and a 'dayofweek' column is added to represent the day of the week for each birth date.

- Another pivot table is created to show the mean births by day of the week for each decade and is visualized in a line plot.

- A final pivot table summarizes births by month and day, and the index is converted to a datetime format for visualization.
